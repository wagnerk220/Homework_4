"""
Module: train.py

This module provides functions to train and evaluate a video classification model.
It includes the main training loop that tracks loss and accuracy over epochs,
updates the best performing model based on validation accuracy, and provides helper
functions to compute the learning rate, batch loss, and epoch loss.

Functions:
    - train: Runs the training and validation loops over a specified number of epochs.
    - get_learning_rate: Retrieves the current learning rate from an optimizer.
    - batch_correct_preds: Computes the number of correct predictions in a mini-batch.
    - get_batch_loss: Computes the loss for a mini-batch and performs backpropagation.
    - get_epoch_loss: Computes the average loss and accuracy over an epoch.
